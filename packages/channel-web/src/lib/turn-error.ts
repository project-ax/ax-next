/**
 * Turn the AI-SDK `onError` (raised by the transport's `error` UIMessageChunk)
 * into either an automatic whole-turn retry (when the turn is provably dead) or
 * a user-visible error+retry banner (when auto-recovery isn't safe). The runtime
 * (`runtime.tsx`) decides which based on the error's shape; these are the two
 * pure helpers it calls.
 *
 * The transport raises an `error` chunk in two cases:
 *   - Fault A — an orchestrator-terminated turn (server `error` SSE frame),
 *     with a mapped friendly label. The runner is PROVABLY DEAD (the
 *     orchestrator fired chat:turn-error → active_session_id cleared), so an
 *     auto-`regenerate()` routes to a FRESH sandbox: safe to auto-retry. The
 *     runtime calls `autoRetryTurn` (once per turn) with `RETRYING_STATUS`.
 *   - CONNECTION_LOST — a bare mid-turn SSE drop (host bounce / network blip).
 *     The runner may still be alive (TASK-24's IPC retry deadline keeps it
 *     running across a host restart), so neither auto-`regenerate()` (could
 *     duplicate a live turn) nor a silent same-reqId resume (could truncate —
 *     the host chunk-buffer + per-reqId seq cursor are in-memory and reset on a
 *     host restart) is loss-free AND duplicate-free. The runtime calls
 *     `applyTurnError` → the manual-retry banner. The turn itself is durable
 *     (TASK-24 commit-notify deadline), so it hydrates on reload.
 *
 * Kept as pure helpers (no React) so they're unit-testable without rendering
 * `useChat`.
 *
 * `regenerate()` re-runs the last user turn: history is persisted server-side
 * and the dead session's `active_session_id` was cleared by
 * `session:terminate`'s conversations subscriber, so the retry routes to a
 * fresh sandbox and re-answers.
