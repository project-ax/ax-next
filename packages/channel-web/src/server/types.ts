 *
 * `text`, `input` (a string-keyed object), and `output` are UNTRUSTED
 * model / tool output (Invariant J2) — JSON-encoded into SSE frames here,
 * sanitized at render in the browser.
 *
 * `seq` (TASK-23) is a HOST-minted monotonic per-reqId chunk cursor stamped
 * by the `ChunkBuffer` as each chunk is buffered (see chunk-buffer.ts). It is
 * NOT carried on the `@ax/ipc-protocol` IPC wire — the runner never supplies
 * it (the host buffer is the sole authority, so untrusted runner content can't
 * steer the client's dedup cursor — Invariant I5). It is therefore OPTIONAL on
 * this type: a chunk straight off the IPC dispatch (before the buffer-fill
 * subscriber stamps it) has no `seq`; once buffered/forwarded it does. The
 * client dedups replayed frames at/below its last-seen `seq` and falls back to
 * the visible CONNECTION_LOST banner on a contiguity gap that exceeds the
 * bounded buffer. `seq` is a plain monotonic int → transport/storage-agnostic
 * (Invariant I1).
