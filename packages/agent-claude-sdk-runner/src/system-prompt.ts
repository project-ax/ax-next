// System-prompt assembly for the claude-agent-sdk query.
//
// Two inputs converge here:
//   1. The agent's frozen, USER-AUTHORED system prompt (empty => fall back
//      to the SDK's `claude_code` preset).
//   2. A runner-authored operational note describing the session-scoped
//      scratch directory (`ephemeralRoot`), when the sandbox provided one.
//
// The note is a FIXED runner-authored string with `ephemeralRoot`
// interpolated. `ephemeralRoot` originates from the sandbox provider
// (AX_EPHEMERAL_ROOT, host-controlled) — never from the model, the user,
// or tool output — so there is no untrusted-input path into the prompt
// here. It is plain prose for the LLM; not interpolated into a shell,
// path, SQL, or URL.
//
// SDK quirk this module exists to handle: the preset form accepts an
// `append` field, but it "has no effect when systemPrompt is a string"
// (sdk.d.ts). So for a custom string prompt we must concatenate the note
// ourselves; for the preset we use the native `append`.
