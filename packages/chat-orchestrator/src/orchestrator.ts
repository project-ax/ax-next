// @ax/chat-orchestrator — per-chat control plane
//
// Registers the host-side `agent:invoke` service hook. One agent:invoke call =
//
//   1. fire chat:start (veto-capable)
//   2. agents:resolve (Week 9.5 ACL gate)
//   3. Decide: route to existing live sandbox, or open fresh? (Task 16, J6)
//        - `ctx.conversationId` set AND its `active_session_id` is alive
//          → route into THAT session's inbox, skip sandbox:open-session.
//        - otherwise → open a fresh sandbox.
//   4. (fresh path) sandbox:open-session — bind IPC listener, spawn runner.
//        The sandbox plugin internally calls `session:create` to mint the
//        session + bearer token (the token flows only into the runner's
//        env, never back to us — I9). We do NOT call session:create here;
//        `session:create` is not idempotent on sessionId and a double-create
//        would throw `duplicate-session`. The orchestrator's contract with
//        the sandbox plugin is: "you own session minting, I own the chat
//        lifecycle above it."
//   5. conversations:bind-session (when ctx.conversationId set) — write
//        active_session_id + active_req_id atomically. The SSE handler
//        (Task 7) keys off active_req_id to find the in-flight stream.
//   6. session:queue-work — enqueue the initial user message
//   7. await chat:end event (runner-driven, via IPC server)
//   8. cleanup — kill handle if still alive (only on the fresh path)
//
// The IPC server (Task 4) fires `chat:end` when the runner POSTs
// /event.chat-end. The orchestrator's own subscriber captures the outcome
// and resolves the awaiting deferred. Error-ish paths (chat:start rejection,
// sandbox-open failure, queue-work failure, chat timeout, sandbox early
// exit) synthesize a terminated outcome and fire chat:end themselves —
// audit-log style subscribers always see exactly one chat:end per agent:invoke.
// Happy-path chat:end is fired by the IPC server, NOT the orchestrator;
// double-firing would double-count in audit-log.
//
// Invariants:
//   I1 — Hook payloads are backend-agnostic. Input is `{ message, maxTurns? }`,
//        output is AgentOutcome — no transport / storage vocabulary (no
//        runnerEndpoint, sessionId leakage, etc.). sessionId exists on
//        AgentContext already, which is the kernel-level primitive.
//   I5 — Capabilities explicit. The orchestrator only calls the exact hooks
//        in its manifest (session:queue-work / session:terminate /
//        sandbox:open-session). It does NOT spawn, it does NOT
//        touch the filesystem, it does NOT open sockets. Those are
//        sandbox-subprocess / ipc-server's jobs.
