/**
 * @ax/auth-oidc public hook payload types.
 *
 * BOUNDARY CONTRACT — these types are the auth alternate-impl boundary
 * (mirrors the `@ax/sandbox-k8s` / `@ax/sandbox-subprocess` pattern).
 * A future `@ax/auth-better-auth`, `@ax/auth-saml`, or `@ax/auth-local`
 * MUST register the same hook surface with the same shapes. Consumers
 * (`@ax/agents`, the chat orchestrator, the CLI bootstrap, channel-web)
 * resolve users only through the bus — they MUST NOT duplicate the
 * `User` type or speak directly to `auth_v1_*` tables.
 *
 * Lock-ins keeping the swap cheap:
 *   1. `User` lives here only. Consumers reference this type, never copy
 *      it. Drift = boundary violation. If a consumer needs a subset
 *      (`{userId, isAdmin}` for an actor payload), that's fine — subsets
 *      don't break alternate impls.
 *   2. Tenant tables (`auth_v1_*`) are scoped to this package's
 *      `store.ts`. The `local/no-bare-tenant-tables` ESLint rule
 *      enforces it; alternate impls own their own tables.
 *   3. IdP-callback error sanitization is part of the contract, not the
 *      impl: an alternate auth plugin MUST log only `error.code`,
 *      NEVER `error.message` (raw IdP errors carry user-controlled
 *      `state` and other request echoes). See `oidc.ts`'s
 *      `auth_callback_failed` log line for the established shape.
 *
 * NOTE on `HttpRequestLike`: this plugin MUST NOT import from
 * `@ax/http-server` (Invariant I2 — no cross-plugin imports). To accept a
 * request adapter without that import, we declare the structural minimum we
 * need locally. `@ax/http-server`'s `HttpRequest` duck-types compatibly
 * because TypeScript's structural typing checks shape, not nominal type.
 * Keeping the surface minimal (cookies + headers) means a future
 * alternate-impl could provide it from a non-HTTP transport with no extra
 * coupling.
