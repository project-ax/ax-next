## Results

| corpus | Config | n | accuracy | recall@5 | uncertain% | p50 ms | p95 ms | $ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| longmemeval-s | E: Orchestrator + BM25 fallback | 500 | 23.0% | 43.8% | 0.4% | 1097 | 1607 | $9.9106 |

## Abstention

| corpus | Config | unanswerable n | correct-refusal | hallucinated | false-refusal (on answerable) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| longmemeval-s | E: Orchestrator + BM25 fallback | 30 | 26 (86.7%) | 4 | 267 / 470 |

## Binding decision

Apply the roadmap's >= 3-point LongMemEval-S accuracy threshold:
- If C beats both A and B by >= 3 points -> Level 3 stays IN.
- If A or B comes within 3 points of C -> Level 3 is OUT.
- If B beats A by a clear margin but C does not beat B -> Level 3 OUT, prioritise reranker (Level 6) in Phase 4.

## Caveats

- Internal corpus is synthetic; treat as directional, not authoritative.
- Judge is Grok 4.3 (cross-family with Sonnet 4.6 agent under test), but still a large model with its own biases. Cross-judge sweep is a Phase 5+ follow-up if the decision is close.
- LongMemEval and LoCoMo are research-licensed datasets; results are not redistributed.
- zeroentropy@0.1.0-alpha.10 (alpha SDK) — re-runs may need to re-pin if the SDK changes.
